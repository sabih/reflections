Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A. A remote repository will be useful when two persons are working together on
a project and both can push their changes on remote. Also remote repository will
be useful for security reasons for example, if local system gets corrupted then
the repository can be fetched to another system from remote.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. If two persons are working on same branch and git pulls automatically the
changes pushed by another person, it might break the functionality of the person
so it is better to pull changes manually when a person is done with his/her
functionality.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

A. Forks are used to copy a repository from github to github.
Clones are used to cpoy a repository from github to local and local to local.
Branches works on a single repository. We might use push and pull to a
repository but branch exist on a repository.

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

A. If the changes are done locally and in between some other user pushed the new
changes to Github then, the last known state of the remote stored locally will
help to inspect the difference between
i. local changes,
ii. the changes done by another person and
iii. previous state of remote stored locally.

In short the last known state of the remote stored in local will help in
collaboration.
