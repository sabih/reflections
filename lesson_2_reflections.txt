Q1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is created inside the working directory which tracks all the
changes done in working directory. It is the first step to create git
repository for working directory.

Q2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. The differences between working directory and repository is tracked by
staging area. Before making any commit to repository, first the files are added
in staging area so that in single commit all logically related files can be
moved to repository.

Q3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

A. First add all the files per logical changes which will go to staging area.
Further commit the changes which will move the changes from staging area to
repository. So, to have one commit per logical change first add all files per
logical change then commit the changes to repository.
