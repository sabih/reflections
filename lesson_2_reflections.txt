Q1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is created inside the working directory which tracks all the
changes done in working directory. It is the first step to create git
repository for working directory.

Q2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. The differences between working directory and repository is tracked by
staging area. Before making any commit to repository, first the files are added
in staging area so that in single commit all logically related files can be
moved to repository.
